            Before the story begins, is it such a sin<br>
            For me to take what's mine, until the end of time?<br>
            We were more than friends, before the story ends<br>
            And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design<br>
            Our love had been so strong for far too long<br>
            I was weak with fear that somethin' would go wrong<br>
            Before the possibilities came true<br>
            I took all possibility from you<br>
            Almost laughed myself to tears<br>
            Conjuring her deepest fears (come here you fucking bitch)<br>
            Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times<br>
            I can't believe it<br>
            Ripped her heart out right before her eyes<br>
            Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it<br>
            She was never this good in bed, even when she was sleepin'<br>
            Now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in<br>
            It goes on and on and on<br>
            I can keep you lookin' young and preserved forever<br>
            With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever<br>
            'Cause I really always knew that my little crime<br>
            Would be cold, that's why I got a heater for your thighs<br>
            And I know, I know it's not your time<br>
            But bye, bye<br>
            And a word to the wise, when the fire dies<br>
            You think it's over but it's just begun<br>
            Baby, don't cry<br>
            You had my heart, at least for the most part<br>
            'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime<br>
            We fell apart, let's make a new start<br>
            'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah<br>
            But baby, don't cry<br>
            Now possibilities I'd never considered<br>
            Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard<br>
            Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave<br>
            To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved<br>
            Smiling right from ear to ear<br>
            Almost laughed herself to tears<br>
            Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times<br>
            I can't believe it<br>
            Ripped his heart out right before his eyes<br>
            Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it (eat the shit out of it)<br>
            Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways<br>
            I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave<br>
            I gotta make up for what I've done<br>
            'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven<br>
            While you burned in hell, no peace forever<br>
            'Cause I really always knew that my little crime<br>
            Would be cold, that's why I got a heater for your thighs<br>
            And I know, I know it's not your time<br>
            But bye, bye<br>
            And a word to the wise, when the fire dies<br>
            You think it's over but it's just begun<br>
            But baby, don't cry<br>
            You had my heart, at least for the most part<br>
            'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime<br>
            We fell apart, let's make a new start<br>
            'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah<br>
            But baby, don't cry<br>
            I will suffer for so long (what will you do, not long enough)<br>
            To make it up to you (I pray to God that you do)<br>
            I'll do whatever you want me to do (well, then, I'll grant you one chance)<br>
            And if it's not enough (if it's not enough, if it's not enough)<br>
            If it's not enough (not enough)<br>
            Try again (try again)<br>
            And again (and again)<br>
            Over and over again<br>
            We're coming back, coming back<br>
            We'll live forever, live forever<br>
            Let's have wedding, have a wedding<br>
            Let's start the killing, start the killing<br>
            Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life<br>
            Yes, I do<br>
            Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life<br>
            I do<br>
            I now pronounce you<br>
            Becuse I really always knew that my little crime<br>
            Would be cold, that's why I got a heater for your thighs<br>
            And I know, I know it's not your time<br>
            But bye, bye<br>
            And a word to the wise, when the fire dies<br>
            You think it's over but it's just begun<br>
            But baby, don't cry<br>
            You had my heart, at least for the most part<br>
            'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime<br>
            We fell apart, let's make a new start, oh<br>
            'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah<br>
            But baby, don't cry<br>
