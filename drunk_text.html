            5th of November<br>
            When I walked you home<br>
            That's when I nearly said it<br>
            But then said "Forget it" and froze<br>
            Do you remember?<br>
            You probably don't<br>
            'Cause the sparks in the sky<br>
            Took a hold of your eyes while we spoke<br><br>
            
            Yesterday, drank way too much<br>
            And stayed up too late<br>
            Started to write what I wanna say<br>
            Deleted the message, but I still remember it said<br><br>
            
            I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight<br>
            Wish I was the reason you stay up 'til 3<br>
            And you can't fall asleep<br>
            Waiting for me to reply<br>
            I wish I was more than just someone you walk by<br>
            Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open<br>
            Instead of just hoping<br>
            You'd feel what I'm feeling inside<br><br>
            
            April the 7th<br>
            And nothing has changed<br>
            It's hard to get by<br>
            When you're still on my mind everyday<br>
            Sometimes I question<br>
            If you feel the same?<br>
            Do we make stupid jokes?<br>
            Trying to hide that we're both too afraid to say<br><br>
            
            I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight<br>
            Wish I was the reason you stay up 'til 3<br>
            And you can't fall asleep<br>
            Waiting for me to reply<br>
            I wish I was more than just someone you walk by<br>
            Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open<br>
            Instead of just hoping<br>
            You'd feel what I'm feeling inside<br><br>
            
            Oh, and here we go again<br>
            Destroy myself to keep a friend<br>
            Hiding away 'cause I was afraid you'd say no<br>
            I wonder if I cross your mind<br>
            Half as much as you do mine<br>
            If I tell you the truth<br>
            What will I lose?<br>
            I don't know<br><br>
            
            I wish I sent you that drunk text at midnight<br>
            I was just scared it would ruin our friendship<br>
            But I really meant it<br>
            I wonder how you would reply
