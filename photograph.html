            Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes<br>
            But it's the only thing that I know<br>
            When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes<br>
            It's the only thing that makes us feel alive<br><br>
            
            We keep this love in a photograph<br>
            We made these memories for ourselves<br>
            Where our eyes are never closing<br>
            Our hearts were never broken<br>
            And time's forever frozen, still<br><br>
            
            So you can keep me<br>
            Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br>
            Holding me close until our eyes meet<br>
            You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home<br><br>
            
            Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul<br>
            And it's the only thing that I know<br>
            I swear it will get easier, remember that we're never repeating ya<br>
            And it's the only thing to take with us when we die<br><br>
            
            We keep this love in a photograph<br>
            We made these memories for ourselves<br>
            Where our eyes are never closing<br>
            Our hearts were never broken<br>
            And time's forever frozen, still<br><br>
            
            So you can keep me<br>
            Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br>
            Holding me close until our eyes meet<br>
            You won't ever be alone<br>
            And if you hurt me<br>
            That's okay baby, there'll be worse things<br>
            Inside these pages you just hold me<br>
            And I won’t ever let you go<br>
            Wait for me to come home<br>
            Wait for me to come home<br>
            Wait for me to come home<br>
            Wait for me to come home<br><br>
            
            You can keep me<br>
            Inside the necklace you bought when you were sixteen<br>
            Next to your heartbeat where I should be<br>
            Keep it deep within your soul<br>
            And if you hurt me<br>
            That's okay baby, there'll be worse things<br>
            Inside these pages you just hold me<br>
            And I won’t ever let you go<br><br>
            
            When I'm going, I will remember how you kissed me<br>
            Under the lamppost back on Sixth street<br>
            Hearing you whisper through the phone<br>
            Wait for me to come home
