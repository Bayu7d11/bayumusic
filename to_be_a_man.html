            I can't hide myself<br>
            I don't expect you to understand<br>
            I just hope I can explain<br>
            What it's like to be a man<br>
            It's a lonely road<br>
            And they don't care 'bout what you know<br>
            It's not 'bout how you feel<br>
            But what you provide inside that home<br><br>
            
            Yeah, I know this life can really beat you down, uh<br>
            You wanna scream but you won't make a sound, uh<br>
            Got so much weight that you've been holdin'<br>
            But won't show any emotion, as a man, that goes unspoken<br>
            That we can't cry when life gets hard<br>
            Unconditional love for women, children and dogs<br>
            We know that we just have to play our parts<br>
            And don't nobody give a damn about our broken hearts, yeah<br>
            As a man, we gotta pave our way<br>
            Our only function is to work and slave<br>
            There's no respect for you if you ain't paid<br>
            You're disregarded as a human and you can't complain<br>
            And if you ever make it up and actually reach that place<br>
            And find a woman that you love and give her your last name<br>
            You'll feel the things that you provide is only why she stays<br>
            And when you try to explain, you'll say<br>
            I can't hide myself<br>
            I don't expect you to understand<br>
            I just hope I can explain<br>
            What it's like to be a man (what it's like to be a man)<br>
            It's a lonely road (it's a lonely road)<br>
            And they don't care 'bout what you know (care 'bout what you know)<br>
            It's not 'bout how you feel<br>
            But what you provide inside that home<br><br>
            
            Don't give up, keep fightin'<br>
            As a man, our son is our horizon<br>
            And our fathers' actions play a role and we end up like him<br>
            So they can't let us see them hurt<br>
            'Cause we'll embody what we do and start a generational curse<br>
            No wonder most men are so depressed<br>
            All the things that they can't express<br>
            They go to war, get thrown on the shelf<br>
            Then go back to war with they mental health<br>
            Then grab that bottle and ask for help<br>
            Try to pull themselves out of hell<br>
            Then fall back down and then realize<br>
            That they gon' have to do it themselves<br>
            It's the circle of life, as a man, you provide<br>
            They don't know what you're worth 'til the day that you die<br>
            And that's when they start cryin'<br>
            Then move on to a man to confide in<br>
            That's why we feel<br>
            We can't hide ourselves<br>
            We don't expect you to understand<br>
            We just hope we can explain<br>
            What it's like to be a man (what it's like to be a man)<br>
            It's a lonely road (it's a lonely road)<br>
            And you don't care 'bout what we know (care 'bout what we know)<br>
            It's not 'bout how we feel<br>
            But what we provide inside that home (inside that home)<br><br>
            
            That home<br>
            It's not 'bout how we feel<br>
            But what we provide inside that home (inside that home)
